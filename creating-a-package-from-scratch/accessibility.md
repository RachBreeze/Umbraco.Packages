# Creating Accessible Umbraco Packages

Creating accessible packages is, a natural extension to accesiblity in an [umbraco context](https://www.skrift.io/issues/accessibility-in-an-umbraco-context/).

The Umbraco UI components have been built to be accessible and have accesiblity tests built within them. Building the user interface (UI) using these components means is a great start to ensuring the package is accessible.
In addition any fixes in the components will be pushed through to the packages being created (as long as you rebuild them with the updates).

## Testing
Accessiblity testing is more than automated testing, and is a specialist skillset. The purpose of this document is to outline some things that can be done to help build accesible packages, it is not a complete list of accessiblity tests that can be performed.

- Build the components using the [Umbraco UI components](https://uui.umbraco.com/) these have accesiblity tests built within them.
- Once built use the keyboard to tab through the elements on the page checking:
  - Focus state, does the element tabed to have a focus state.
  - Does the tab order make sense
- Check the UI with a screen reader. [NVDA have a free screen reader](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/) and some guidelines on screen reader testing are available from [webaim](https://webaim.org/articles/screenreader_testing/)
- Install use an accesiblity testing tool as a plugin into your browser to run automated tests, tools like [axe DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd) are built to reduce the number of false positives in a test.
- If the UI does not follow the Umbraco Style then check the contrast with a tool like [WCAG Contrast Checker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wcag-color-contrast-check/plnahcmalebffmaghcpcmpaciebdhgdf) will help ensure contrast.
